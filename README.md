# A Mathematician's $\log$book

The idea for this project came out of a post by someone who religiously took LaTeX notes of everything he had learned, every day, like a logbook. Since I forfeit the chance to do that during my studies but still had all my hand-written lecture notes and the course material, I wanted to start something in a similar vein.

So here I aim to present at least part of what I learned during my bachelors and masters degree, first and foremost just to revisit, but as a future reference, too. I also want to incorporate additional sources at any point I see fit.

Since it may be useful to others, I thought it is good to make it publicly available. If you like what you see or have any criticism, send me a mail or open an issue.

This logbook contains German and English lecture notes. If only one language is available at any point, I haven't gotten around to translate it yet. I have refrained from using the *multilang* package for now because it seemed too cumbersome managing all the custom commands, instead just wrapping chunks of text using the *iflang* package.

Please note that this will likely be a **WIP draft** for a long (!) time.
